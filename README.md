This project aims to forecast the outcomes of the NBA Western Conference playoffs for the 2023-24 season. This is a significant challenge in sports analytics, given the unpredictable nature of basketball, especially in a highly competitive environment like the NBA Western Conference. The predictions hold value not only for sports analytics but also for the strategic, financial, and marketing decisions of the teams. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the outcomes of the NBA Western Conference playoffs. This involves analyzing extensive datasets, including individual player statistics and overall team performance.
